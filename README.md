This is the code repository for [Machine Learning with Scala Quick Start Guide](Packt UTM URL of the Book), published by Packt.

**Leverage popular machine learning algorithms and techniques and implement them in Scala**

## What is this book about?
Scala is a highly scalable integration of object-oriented nature and functional programming concepts that make it easy to build scalable and complex big data applications. This book is a handy guide for machine learning developers and data scientists who want to develop and train effective machine learning models in Scala.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get acquainted with JVM-based machine learning libraries for Scala such as Spark ML and Deeplearning4j
* Learn RDDs, DataFrame, and Spark SQL for analyzing structured and unstructured data
* Understand supervised and unsupervised learning techniques with best practices and pitfalls
* Learn classification and regression analysis with linear regression, logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, support vector machine, and tree-based ensemble techniques
* Learn effective ways of clustering analysis with dimensionality reduction techniques

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
rawTrafficDF.select("Hour (Coded)", "Immobilized bus", "Broken Truck", 
                    "Vehicle excess", "Fire", "Slowness in traffic (%)").show(5)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for machine learning developers looking to train machine learning models in Scala without spending too much time and effort. Some fundamental knowledge of Scala programming and some basics of statistics and linear algebra is all you need to get started with this book.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-7).
